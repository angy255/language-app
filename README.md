<!-- # 🌍 Multilingual Team App: Breaking Barriers with AI 🤖
Built to help global teams communicate naturally across languages without losing meaning in translation.

Translate messages between English, Spanish, and French while preserving cultural context and idioms — because "I'm in a pickle" shouldn't become "Estoy en un pepinillo" 🥒

⚠️ Work in Progress: This application is currently under active development. Features and functionality are being continuously improved and expanded.
